    Menstrual cramps are throbbing, aching cramps you get in your lower belly just before and during your period. Theyâ€™re some of the most common, annoying parts of your period.

If you have mild menstrual cramps, take aspirin or another pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen,or naproxen. For best relief, take these medications as soon as bleeding or cramping starts.
    
Heat can also help. Place a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower back or tummy. A warm bath may also provide some relief.
    
Avoid foods with caffeine and salt.
    
Massage your lower back and abdomen.

While itâ€™s true that women who live together may indeed get their periods at the same time, the scientific evidence supporting the theory that living together causes menstrual synchrony remains unclear. 
The concept arose in 1971 when then University of Chicago psychologist Martha McClintock published a paper with her theory that womenâ€™s bodies react to the pheromones of other women around them, and it causes a synchronization of menstruation. 
She did a follow-up study that supported her theory in 1998. However, others have tested McClintockâ€™s theory and the scientific results remain divided. Women who live together sometimes do get their periods at the same time, but it may just be a coincidence.''')

    Missed or late periods happen for many reasons other than pregnancy. Common causes can range from hormonal imbalances to serious medical conditions.

There are also two times in a womanâ€™s life when itâ€™s totally normal for her period to be irregular: when it first begins, and when menopause starts. As your body goes through the transition, your normal cycle can become irregular.

Most women who havenâ€™t reached menopause usually have a period every 28 days. However, a healthy menstrual cycle can range from every 21 to 35 days. If your period doesnâ€™t fall within these ranges, it could be because of one of the following reasons.
1. Stress
2. Low body weight

4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
5. Birth control

    Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects a womanâ€™s hormone levels.

Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal amounts of male hormones. This hormone imbalance causes them to skip menstrual periods and makes it harder for them to get pregnant.

PCOS also causes hair growth on the face and body, and baldness. And it can contribute to long-term health problems like diabetes and heart disease.

Birth control pills and diabetes drugs can help fix the hormone imbalance and improve symptoms.
